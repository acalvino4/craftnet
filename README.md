# Craftnet

Craftnet is the Craft project that powers various services for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com), including [id.craftcms.com](https://id.craftcms.com), [plugins.craftcms.com](https://plugins.craftcms.com), and the [Craftnet API](https://docs.api.craftcms.com).

It is not meant to be self-installable. Weâ€™ve published it to a public repo for the [issue tracking](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/craftnet/issues) and because we hope some aspects of the code will serve as helpful examples for other advanced Craft projects.
