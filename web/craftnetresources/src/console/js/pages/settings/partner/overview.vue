    <pane>
      <p>Welcome to Craft Partners. Here is where you will manage your
        <router-link to="profile">Partner Network</router-link>
        .
      </p>

      <p>We ask that you completely populate your profile with all
        relevant information. While in this Beta state you won’t be
        able to see how your profile will look on the live site,
        however, once Craft Partners goes live later this month, you
        will be able to continue to edit all of the information
        (other than the website slug) in your profile, whenever
        you’d like. We encourage Partners to continually add new
        projects to their gallery and ensure that their profile’s
        information is current.</p>

      <p>Following the launch of Craft Partners, we will begin the
        Verification process. Once you've been verified we will
        add the corresponding verified badge to your profile.</p>

      <p>All Partners will receive the Craft Partner badge that you
        can add to your own website and marketing materials prior
        to launch. Verified badges will be sent out once the Partner
        has been verified.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:partners@craftcms.com">partners@craftcms.com</a>.
